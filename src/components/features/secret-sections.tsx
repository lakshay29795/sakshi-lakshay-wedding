      story: `It was a crisp autumn evening in October, and I had been planning this moment for months. I told Sakshi we were going to our favorite restaurant for dinner, but little did she know, I had something much more special planned.

I had secretly coordinated with her best friend Maya to get her to the park where we had our first official date. The same bench where we sat and talked for hours, where I first knew I was falling in love with her.

I was so nervous that I almost forgot the ring at home! Thank goodness for my best man who reminded me to check my pocket one more time. My hands were shaking so much that I could barely hold the ring box.

When Sakshi arrived and saw the setup - fairy lights strung between the trees, rose petals scattered around our bench, and our song playing softly from a hidden speaker - she immediately started crying. She knew what was happening before I even got down on one knee.

I had practiced my speech a hundred times, but when I looked into her eyes, all those rehearsed words flew out of my head. Instead, I just spoke from my heart about how she makes every day brighter, how she's my best friend and my greatest love, and how I want to spend the rest of my life making her as happy as she makes me.

When I finally asked "Will you marry me?", she was crying so hard she could barely speak. But her "YES!" was the most beautiful sound I've ever heard. We both cried, we laughed, we kissed, and in that moment, everything was perfect.

The ring fit perfectly (thanks to Maya for secretly finding out her size), and as we sat on our bench holding each other, I knew that this was just the beginning of our greatest adventure together.`,

      story: `Getting our families' blessings was almost as nerve-wracking as the proposal itself! 

**Asking Sakshi's Parents:**
I was terrified to ask Sakshi's dad for his blessing. I had planned this whole formal speech, but when I sat down with him, he just smiled and said, "I've been waiting for you to ask. You make our daughter so happy, and that's all we could ever want for her." Her mom immediately started crying happy tears and hugged me so tight I could barely breathe!

**Telling My Parents:**
My parents had been dropping hints about marriage for months, so when I told them I was going to propose, my mom literally jumped up and down. Dad just nodded approvingly and said, "About time, son. She's perfect for you." Then mom immediately started planning the engagement party!

**The Grandparents:**
Sakshi's grandmother pulled me aside at a family dinner and whispered, "When are you going to make an honest woman out of my granddaughter?" I nearly choked on my food! Turns out, the whole family had been waiting for this moment.

**The Siblings:**
Sakshi's sister Maya was my secret accomplice in the proposal planning. My brother kept asking if he could be the best man before I had even proposed! The siblings were definitely the most excited of everyone.`,
